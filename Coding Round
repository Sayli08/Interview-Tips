Think out loud :

Ask clarifying questions 
Callout assumptions 
Note: if you have limited time then you can say " I am assuming that for this problem if input is negative then it should return null "
Explain the idea before coding using example
Note : If you are explaining brute force approach then you can say "This is the basic approach and it can be optimized" "I think this could be good Approach"
Edge cases
Input parameters for the APIs
Coding [Code Walk Through] 
Exmple Walkthrough using code
Time Complexity 
Space Complexity
Optimization
