Title: Mastering Coding Interviews: Step-by-Step Guide

Note: Think Out Loud : Always verbalize your thought process. This shows your interviewer how you approach problems and that you're actively engaging with the question.

Steps :

- Ask clarifying questions : Begin by ensuring you fully understand the problem. Ask questions to clarify any doubts. This demonstrates your attention to detail and ensures you're on the right track.

- Callout assumptions 
Ex: I assume that  if the array is empty then  the api should return empty string ....

Note: if you have limited time then you can say " I am assuming that for this problem if input is negative then it should return null "
Explain the idea before coding using example
Note : If you are explaining brute force approach then you can say "This is the basic approach and it can be optimized" "I think this could be good Approach"

- Outline the Approach: 
Before we start coding, it's essential to outline our approach using a specific example. Here are the key aspects that should be covered while explaining our strategy:
  1. Data Structures: Identify the data structures you intend to utilize, explaining their efficiency and why they are suitable for this problem. This demonstrates your understanding of DS and their practical application.
  2. Algorithm/Strategy: Describe the specific algorithm or strategy you plan to use.
  3. API Walkthrough: Outline the input parameters and detail any looping mechanisms, including their expected outcomes.
  4. Handling Edge Cases: Explain how the solution addresses potential edge cases to ensure robustness.
  5. Efficiency and Optimizations: Highlight how the chosen algorithm optimizes performance and any specific efficiency gains.
  6. Example Run-Through: Provide a step-by-step example to illustrate how your solution works in practice.
  7. Complexity Analysis: Discuss the time and space complexities of your algorithm, providing a clear understanding of its scalability.
  8. Potential Improvements and Limitations: Outline any possible enhancements and acknowledge limitations, suggesting how they might be addressed in future iterations.
EX:
 To address this problem ,Let me start with a naive approach/straightforward approach.....
